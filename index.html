            <article class="text">
                Nothing is more annoying than having creassed clothes especially when it's your favourite ones.
                Now I know you can just iron them but this is the wonderful joy of this life hack,
                When I found out about this hack I've never looked back, first what you need to do is get some ice cubes,
                secondly throw said ice cubes in the dryer. And that's it! Once the ice cubes melt in the dryer the steam
                will start to do it's magic this will remove all the wrinkles. However this trick isn't as effective with
                heavier clothes but it will work like a charm with all of your lighter weight clothes.

            <article class="text">
                  <!--img of salad with dressing-->
                Instead if removing the foil from dressing or oil, what you should do is poke holes in it
                instead. That way you'll never have dressing come pouring out of the bottle and getting everywhere
                saving you time so you don't have to clean up, saving you from over dressing your salads and also
                from all those extra calories. This works great with vegetable oil, rubbing alcohol and mineral oil.
