# Project1
 
‘Life hacks’ is a website based around that of a blog like site, providing short and simple tips and tricks. A life hack is a strategy or technique in order to manage one’s time and daily activities in a more efficient way. The website was focused on some of the top 10 life hacks that were hand selected by me so it can range from person to person. The site is targeted towards people who want to find out new ways to navigate little things throughout their life and make them easier.

Features
•	Navigation bar
The navigation bar was kept at a basic level and consistent placement on all four parts of the website easy to read. This included a ‘Home’ page, ‘content’, ‘About’ and a ‘Feedback’ page.
•	Use of images and videos
I used a lot of images to highlight emotions and feelings during and throughout the site, along with the type of website that I was working on visual representation helps aid the user to either understand what the sections was about .
•	About section
Adding a fictional about section making the website feel more real and connected 
•	Footer
The footer is at the end of the page short and simple with a ‘find us’ tag line. Next to the tag line are three links to Social Medias such as facebook, twitter and instagram. The links used will open a new tab so it keeps the user on the main page and doesn’t complicate navigation for the user. This insinuates that the site/organisation is active on other platforms and users could find updates or other sorts of information if they we’re to follow said social Medias. (since Life Hacks is not a real site or company the link will only go to the social media’s main websites.)

•	Feedback section
The ‘Feedback’ section of the website keeps the connection with the user close by asking for personal feedback makes the user’s opinion feel wanted and validated. The feedback question simply asks the user ‘How can we improve your experience with us?’ by posing this question such as this it keeps the user interaction. The text area is blank with a entre feedback button and a reset form button. 

Features which could be implemented in the future
•	Making improvements to the navigation bar
I found that the nav bar could be made to be and look a lot more appealing. I was thinking of making it follow the page but can also collapse so that it will not get in the way of any text or distract the user.
•	A logo image
A logo image would have worked well into making the website look more realistic and believable.
Design
Imagery:
The use of images in the website to keep the site engaging and entertaining, each picture used was relevant to the content displayed. The pictures were used not to distract but keep the flow of the site on point.
Colour scheme:
The colour scheme was originally different then the finally product, there was a lot of trail and error before leaving it the way it was using sites such as ‘Lily bug design’ to help pick a colour scheme and theme for the website. At first a more steel type of colours was used, however this gave a cold feel to the site and didn’t make it inviting along with this it became hard to make the other colours pop and stand out. Keeping with a white background colour and black text led to the site looking simple but able to keep the information and pictures still being able to stand out.
